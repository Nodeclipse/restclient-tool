SSL Handling
--------------
By default RestClient is configured to disable verification of SSL certificate and hostname. 
So default allows working over SSL connection without respecting SSL at all. This behavior can be
controlled by overriding default SSL properties. For that one should copy property file
http://svn.codespot.com/a/eclipselabs.org/restclient-tool/trunk/standalone/conf/rest-client_override.properties
to user's home directory and adjust properties as explained below.

i.e.
use.self.signed.cert.verifier=false
disable.ssl.cert.verifier=true
disable.host.name.verifier=true

Verify Self Signed Certificate
---------------------------------
Self signed certificate verifier can be enabled by setting property
use.self.signed.cert.verifier=true

When it's enabled all standard SSL certificates may pass because it uses only first certificate from chain of certificates.

Verify Standard SSL Certificates
----------------------------------
To verify SSL certificates which are signed by CA as recognized by JVM (contains certificates of CAs, distributed with JVM).
Set these properties

use.self.signed.cert.verifier=false	(make sure self signed certificate verifier is to set false)
disable.ssl.cert.verifier=false

Verify Hostname
----------------
To verify hostname contained in certificate, set property

disable.host.name.verifier=false
