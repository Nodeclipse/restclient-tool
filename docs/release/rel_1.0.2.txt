List Issues/Enhancements:
1. New lines (CR) get removed from text file while submitting it as POST body.
2. Some time response body is displayed in a single line. It should be displayed as is if no indentation.
3. Content-Type header goes blank when posting any file.
4. Display body part of request pane is not encoded (with UTF-8) while actually client submits encoded params body string. It is misleading.
5. Request pane doesn't display content if request results erroneous response.
6. Request pane doesn't display actual post body message format if request is multipart/form-data.
7. Add OPTIONS and TRACE HTTP methods.
8. Do not verify host names in SSL certificate. Allow all host names. E.g. https://bamutil.qa.mlb.com/utils-dashboard/linkgen/
